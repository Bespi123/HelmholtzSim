# HelmholtzSim: Helmholtz Coils Designer

## Overview

Helmholtz Coils Designer is a Python-based tool for designing and optimizing Helmholtz coil configurations. The software provides functionalities to estimate the required DC power sources, determine optimal coil configurations, and simulate magnetic field distributions using numerical methods.

## Features

- **Magnetic Field Calculation**: Computes the magnetic field generated by Helmholtz coils.
- **Power Optimization**: Uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the coil parameters for minimal power consumption.
- **AWG Wire Selection**: Selects the appropriate American Wire Gauge (AWG) based on current requirements.
- **Resistance Estimation**: Calculates the coil resistance using copper wire properties.
- **Simulation Framework**: Supports parallelized coil simulations for efficiency.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- Required Python libraries (install using `requirements.txt`)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Bespi123/helmholtzCoilsDesigner.git
   cd helmholtzCoilsDesigner
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Optimization

To run the coil optimization, execute:

```sh
python main.py
```

### Example: Computing Magnetic Field

You can use the simulation functions to compute the magnetic field:

```python
from helmholtz_sim import CoilSimulation
sim = CoilSimulation()
field = sim.compute_field(I=5, N=100, radius=0.2)
print(field)
```

### Example: Selecting AWG Size

```python
from utils import select_awg
awg_size = select_awg(3.5)  # Selects the smallest AWG that can handle 3.5A
print("Recommended AWG:", awg_size)
```
